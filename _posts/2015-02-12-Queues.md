title: Mind Your P's and Queue's
feature-img: "img/sample_feature_img.png"
excerpt: I just waited in a long queue for a California burrito today, said no one ever. THIS IS AMERICA! We call them lines here, damnit. We're talking data structures of course, and now that we've taken a look at stacks let's move on to their sibling the queue.

###Overview

A queue is full of vowels, and it also happens to be an abstract data type (ADT) that is used to order elements in a collection and allow addition and deletion in a First-In-First-Out style. When a value is added into the queue, it is added to the rear terminal position and is known as an enqueue. When a value is removed, it is removed from the front terminal poistion and is known as a dequeue.

###Benefits

There are pretty obvious and already alluded to real-life comparisons for a queue but for clarity's sake let's just mention a deli line. With regards to computer science comparisons we could see a queue being used to store instructions to execute, with the instructions being received in numerical order as they are dequeued from the head of the queue.

Something that I declined to mention in the previous article is abstraction. If you use Javascript, you are already familiar with arrays. A javascript array could easily been seen as a queue because there are already native methods for enqueue and dequeue (shift and push). However, a JS array affords more interface options (think of an instrument or piece of machinery that has more 'options' or 'knobs' or interfaces through which you could change settings) win exchange for a decline in speed. This decline in speed compared to a Array.pop() or a queue's shift method is due to the fact that JS arrays must be re-indexed to account for an element being removed.

###Implementations

Just like with stacks, queues are 'integrated' into JS arrays with the appropriate interfaces of enqueue and dequeue. However, to fully utilize the speed of a queue we would need to build it using standard JS objects. The code will look similar to a stack in the way that it is laid out, but different with regards to the methods.

We'll be following a typical pseudoclassical inheritance pattern starting with the constructor. The 'first' property that is inherited by all queue objects points to the first value that enqueued.

{% highlight js %}

var Queue = function() {
  this.first = null;
  this.size = 0;

};

{% endhighlight %}

Just like in the stack data structure, we'll be using a node to contain both the value passed in and a pointer to the value in front of it in the queue.

{% highlight js %}

var Node = function(value){
  this.value = value;
  this.next = null;
};

{% endhighlight %}

Next comes the good stuff. If you aren't family with pseudoclassical inheritance, what we are doing with these methods is adding them to the queue prototype so that we are not saddled with the repetitiveness of typing down these functions for every instance. When the 'new' keyword is invoked to create an instance of the queue object and a method is called using that instance, the computer will look to the instance and not find the enqueue or dequeue methods, but will look up the prototype chain to invoke them. 

{% highlight js %}

Queue.prototype.enqueue = function(value) {
  var node = new Node(value);

  if (!this.first){
    this.first = node;
  } else {
    temp = this.first;
    while (temp.next) {
      temp = temp.next;
    }
    temp.next = node;
  }

  this.size += 1;
  return node;
};

Queue.prototype.dequeue = function() {
  temp = this.first;
  this.first = this.first.next;
  this.size -= 1;
  return temp;
};

{% endhighlight %}

Tune in next time for some linked lists!
